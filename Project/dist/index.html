    <p class="lead text-justify">
        Our project focuses on Cloud Gaming and the roadblocks it faces within Canada. As we know, Canada is the second largest country in the world, but all 9.98 million square kilometers of Canada is not the same, and neither is the technology available. We are going to explore the challenges that come with cloud gaming in Canada, and how we, as a country, can possibly overcome them. We will be looking at the current technological divide within Canada and how we can bridge the gap between the haves and the have-nots. To truly understand the issue, we are using the Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How framework to dive into the challenges cloud gaming faces in Canada.
