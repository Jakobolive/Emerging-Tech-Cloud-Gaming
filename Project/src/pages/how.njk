        <h2>The Role of Government Initiatives</h2>
        <p class="highlight">The <strong>CRTC</strong> (Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission) is actively improving connectivity in rural Canada through the <strong>Broadband Fund</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Since 2019, the fund has connected over 270 communities with high-speed internet and cellphone services.</li>
            <li>Essential institutions like schools, healthcare centers, and community hubs are prioritized for upgrades.</li>
            <li>Recent efforts include bringing fiber internet to 16 rural communities in Manitoba.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Harnessing Data Centers in Rural Communities</h2>
        <p>Rural areas are increasingly attractive for data centers due to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Colder climates</strong> reducing cooling costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Affordable land</strong> making large-scale operations viable.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic benefits</strong> such as job creation and local investments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="highlight">For example, small towns in the U.S. like those in Virginia and Iowa are leveraging these advantages to host facilities for tech giants, creating a model Canada can follow.</p>

        <h2>Legislative Support for Faster Deployment</h2>
        <p>Ontario's government is removing bureaucratic barriers to speed up infrastructure projects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Property laws allow faster land acquisition for internet towers with fair compensation to owners.</li>
            <li>Interactive maps showcase ongoing and planned high-speed projects in areas like First Nations communities and Highway 11-17 corridors.</li>
