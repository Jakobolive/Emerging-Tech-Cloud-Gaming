            <p>
                Connectivity remains a significant challenge in Canada, particularly in rural and remote areas. 
                Limited access to high-speed internet and reliable cellular networks creates a digital divide, 
                leaving communities disconnected from essential online services and emerging technologies.

            <h3>Impact on Cloud Gaming</h3>
            <p>
                Cloud gaming relies heavily on stable, high-speed internet connections to deliver a seamless 
                gaming experience. Without adequate connectivity, players in underserved regions face:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Laggy or unresponsive gameplay due to high latency.</li>
                <li>Inability to access or stream games from cloud services.</li>
                <li>Missed opportunities to engage with cutting-edge gaming technologies.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mt-5">
            <h3>Why is This Important?</h3>
            <p>
                Cloud gaming represents the future of gaming by reducing the need for expensive hardware, 
                enabling access across devices, and offering flexibility in gameplay. However, without 
                proper internet infrastructure, rural and remote Canadians risk being excluded from 
                these advancements.
