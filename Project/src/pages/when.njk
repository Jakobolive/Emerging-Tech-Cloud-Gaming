            <p>
                Connectivity issues in Canada have roots in the countryâ€™s vast geography and the challenges 
                of building infrastructure in rural and remote areas. Early internet adoption in urban centers 
                during the 1990s left rural areas lagging behind, creating a digital divide that persists today.
