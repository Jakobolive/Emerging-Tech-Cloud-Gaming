            <h2 class="text-danger">Regions Most Affected</h2>
            <p>
                Connectivity challenges are most prevalent in rural and remote regions of Canada. 
                The countryâ€™s vast geography and sparse populations in certain areas make it difficult 
                to deploy and maintain modern internet infrastructure. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the most affected regions include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Northern Canada**: Areas such as Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, and parts of Yukon.</li>
                <li>**Rural Atlantic Canada**: Newfoundland and Labrador, and remote parts of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.</li>
                <li>**Prairie Provinces**: Farmland and rural communities in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.</li>
                <li>**Remote British Columbia**: Mountainous regions and islands with limited connectivity.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Target Areas for Improvement</h3>
            <p>
                The federal government and private sectors have identified priority areas for broadband 
                expansion and 5G deployment. These include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rural towns within **100 km of major cities**, to provide better access to underserved populations.</li>
                <li>Key industries in remote regions, such as **mining operations in northern Ontario** and Alberta.</li>
                <li>Indigenous communities that lack basic infrastructure for internet connectivity.</li>
                <li>Tourist-heavy areas, such as **Prince Edward Island** and remote parts of the Rockies, where demand for connectivity is growing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Visualizing the Impact</h3>
            <p>
                The maps below illustrate the availability of high-speed internet versus underserved regions 
                and population density in Canada. These visuals will help provide a clearer picture of 
                connectivity gaps and target areas for improvement.
