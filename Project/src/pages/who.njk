                    <p>
                        Many rural areas in Canada struggle with inadequate internet infrastructure, making activities such as cloud gaming a challenge. According to the CRTC, over 270 communities have been improved since 2019, but significant gaps remain, particularly in Northern and remote areas.

                        Cloud Gaming requires low latency and high internet speeds for the most Sucsess. Connectivity issues lead to slower speeds and higher latency, which directly impacts the quality of cloud gaming, where stable and high-speed internet is essential.

                    <p>
                        Cloud gaming requires a reliable internet connection to deliver low latency and high-resolution streaming. In Canada, gamers in rural areas face challenges such as longer load times, frequent buffering, and lower-quality graphics.

                    <p>
                        Platforms like Google Stadia struggled in part due to these connectivity barriers, as they couldn't reach audiences in areas with limited broadband access. getting better internet acsesss in more people hands will prevent connectivity issues.

                    <h2>Impact on Local Economies</h2>
                    <p>
                        Poor connectivity doesn't just hinder gaming but also limits opportunities for rural areas to host data centers or attract tech investments. As seen in rural America, data centers can bring jobs and economic benefits, but they require robust infrastructure.

                        Improving connectivity in Canada could open doors for similar growth in rural communities, like creating jobs and giving companies more opportunities to set up in Canada
