            <h2 class="text-danger">Urban vs. Rural Inequality</h2>
            <p>
                The primary cause of connectivity issues in Canada is the stark inequality between 
                urban and rural areas. Urban centers such as Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal enjoy 
                high-speed internet access with cutting-edge technologies like fiber optics and 5G. 
                However, many rural and remote communities lag significantly behind, relying on outdated 
                infrastructure or lacking internet access altogether.

            <h3 class="text-secondary">Key Reasons Behind the Problem</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Geographic Challenges:</strong> 
                    Canada's vast and varied terrain makes it expensive and technically challenging to 
                    lay cables or build cell towers in remote regions. Mountains, forests, and sparse 
                    populations increase infrastructure costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>High Costs for Providers:</strong> 
                    Service providers often prioritize urban areas with dense populations, where they 
                    can maximize returns on investment. Serving rural areas often involves higher 
                    expenses and lower revenue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lack of Competition:</strong> 
                    Many rural regions are dominated by a single provider, leading to higher costs 
                    and limited service quality for residents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Policy Gaps:</strong> 
                    While the Canadian government has launched initiatives to improve connectivity, 
                    regulatory hurdles and inconsistent funding have slowed progress in rural broadband expansion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Technology Limitations:</strong> 
                    Satellite and wireless solutions, which are common in rural areas, often have 
                    higher latency and lower speeds compared to urban broadband infrastructure.

            <h3>Implications of Digital Inequality</h3>
            <p>
                The lack of reliable internet in rural areas has far-reaching consequences, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Economic Impact:</strong> Limited internet access restricts rural businesses from 
                    competing in digital markets and reduces opportunities for innovation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Educational Disparities:</strong> Students in rural areas struggle with online learning 
                    due to poor connectivity, widening the education gap.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Healthcare Access:</strong> Telemedicine, which requires high-speed internet, 
                    is often unavailable in remote regions.
